lfne-ubuntu-22.04.gns3a - LFNE Ubuntu distro based GNS3 Appliance

lfne-almalinux-9.2.gns3a - LFNE AlmaLinux (Centos replacement) distro based GNS3 Appliance

Based on LFNE Docker images (https://hub.docker.com/r/yotis/lfne)

Formerly known as PFNE - Python For Network Engineer, the images developed to be more than just for Python learning.

Linux images build with all tools need by network engineers to perform various tasks ranging from simple python script to automation and testing.
